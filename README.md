ğŸ¤‘ A blackjack strategy program written in python to reccomend the best play according to the users total and dealers upcard.\
ğŸ¤‘ I'll add a card counting function later.\
ğŸ¤‘ More error checking needs to be added. \
ğŸ¤‘ A variable bet percentage reccomendation based on card count coming soon...\
ğŸ¤‘ Computer Vision would be fun to try...
